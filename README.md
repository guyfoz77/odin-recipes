A project where I create my first website.
By the end of this project, I hope to have a better understanding of
how to set up a website, and how all the html works to produce
what is seen on the screen.

Mainly, I would like to better understand git and github, so will
focus on that for this project too.

One thing I will do, is write the boilerplate HTML myself. I know
VSCose can do it automatically but for the time being I shall write
it all out manually so I can keep going over what it all does.
